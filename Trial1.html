<h1> <font face = "Trebuchet MS">My name is Manya </h1></font>
<p> <font face = "Trebuchet MS" size = "5">These days, quarantine has me stuck at home, so I tend to read books. My favourite book series include <u>Harry Potter</u> and <u>Percy Jackson</u>, but I also like to read nonfiction. My screen-time has also gone up (as expected) and I have recently started watching Marvel movies. Apart from these things and homework, there isn't much to do when you're at home all day, so I hope the pandemic lifts soon and I can see my friends again.</p></font>
